Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overrided the constructors of Cafe, House and Library. Because sometimes we don't know to much details like who is the residents, but we still want to construct a building.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Everything is fine.
