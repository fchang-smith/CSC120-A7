- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
First, I believe that the goToFloor() method in Building class can already represent building with elevators, because people can go to whatever floors they want. So instead of overloading the gotoFloor method, I overload the goUp() method. Originally, people can only go up 1 level, but in Cafe class, I overload it to be able to go up multiple levels at one action (if there is an elevator in the Cafe).
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I am pretty busy this week, so I only finish a small part of this homework. I will resubmit it when I have time to finish all parts.
